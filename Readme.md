## Project Overview
This project focuses on rendering a 3D planet using WebGL. The main functionalities include initializing the planet's geometry, setting up shaders, and rendering the planet with rotation and revolution animations.

## Current State
### What Works
- **Initialization**: The planet's geometry is correctly initialized with vertices, normals, and texture coordinates.
- **Rendering**: The planet is rendered with correct transformations including rotation and revolution.
- **Shaders**: Basic shaders are set up for vertex positions and normals.
- **Uniforms and Attributes**: Properly binds attributes and uniforms for rendering.
- **Lighting**: Lighting is now implemented, providing realistic shading on the planet's surface.
- **Texture Mapping**: Texture mapping is now working, allowing the planet to have realistic textures.
- **Orbit Path**: The orbit path of the planet is now visible, providing a visual representation of its revolution.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have a WebGL compatible browser.
2. Open the main HTML file in your browser to view the rendered planet.
3. Adjust the shader source paths if necessary to ensure they are correctly loaded.
